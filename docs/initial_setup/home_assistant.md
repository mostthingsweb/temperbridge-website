## Version requirement

TemperBridge is supported on Home Assistant version **2023.2** and later. Please update HA to at least 2023.2 before purchasing and setup.

It *may* work on earlier versions but I cannot guarantee it. Also, regardless of what version of HA you are using, 
the ESPHome integration version needs to be at least [2021.9.0](https://esphome.io/changelog/2021.9.0.html) since that's 
when support for encryption keys was added.
